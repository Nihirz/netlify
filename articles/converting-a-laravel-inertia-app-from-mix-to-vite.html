                        I recently converted my Inertia app from Laravel Mix to using Vite. In this post I'll talk about how it went, as well as some of the gotchas.
                    </p>
                    <div class="wysiwyg mt-small">
                        <h2>Initial Thoughts</h2>
<p>I'd like to start off by saying I think the decision to move from <a href="https://laravel-mix.com/">Mix</a> to <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a> in a minor Laravel release (<code>9.2.0</code>) was a mistake.</p>
<p>Vite is very different from Mix in a lot of ways, and now any time someone makes a new Laravel app it's going to use Vite. It's going to be very jarring for a big part of community.</p>
<p>It's easy to forget the majority of everyday Laravel developers aren't on Twitter and &quot;in&quot; the community. They're trying to get their work done so they can home and enjoy their lives. I believe there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Jumping In Head First</h2>
<p>When I saw Vite was going to be the default I was apprehensive, mainly because it was new, however I was more than willing to jump in head first.</p>
<p>I initially tried using Vite on my own a few weeks before <a href="https://jessarcher.com/">Jess Archer</a> did all the hard work getting the proper implementation done. I'll be honest, I struggled big time and gave up after about an hour of frustration.</p>
<p>However, thanks to Jess's hard work, it made my life a lot easier than it would've been!</p>
<h3>Problems with Inertia</h3>
<p>There's one major difference between Webpack and Vite that threw me a curve ball. It's that Vite doesn't support it when you use await import statements for your Inertia layouts, so the following code now longer works:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import { createInertiaApp } from '@inertiajs/inertia-vue3';
import UserLayout from './src/layouts/User';
createInertiaApp({
    resolve: async name =&gt; {
        let page = (await import(`./src/views/${name}`)).default;
        page.layout ??= UserLayout;
        return page;
    },
});
</code></pre>
<p>It needed to be changed to use the new <a href="https://github.com/laravel/vite-plugin"><code>laravel-vite-plugin</code></a>, which helps with resolving the templates.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import { createInertiaApp } from '@inertiajs/inertia-vue3';
import { resolvePageComponent } from 'laravel-vite-plugin/inertia-helpers';
createInertiaApp({
    resolve: async name =&gt; {
        let page = resolvePageComponent(`./src/views/${name}.vue`, import.meta.glob('./src/views/**/*.vue'));
        return page;
    },
});
</code></pre>
<p>This created a problem because I can no longer specify the &quot;default&quot; page template for my Inertia pages. Now I have to manually specify it in every Vue page.</p>
<p>At first this bugged me, however I later realised it's actually better becuase the layout of the current page is no longer obscured while you're editing it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import UserLayout from &quot;@js/layouts/User.vue&quot;;
export default {
    layout: UserLayout,
    data() {
        return {
            title: &quot;Dashboard&quot;,
        };
    },
};
</code></pre>
<h3>Vue Imports and File Extensions</h3>
<p>In my app I've got a lot of imports for things like components and layouts. This is just part of the development experience when it comes to building an SPA. The issue I ran into is that when compiling with Webpack, you can omit the <code>.vue</code> file extension, so you get something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import Button from &quot;@js/components/Button&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>Unfortunately Vite doesn't like it when there's no file extension and will fall apart.</p>
<p>This isn't a criticism of Vite, I actually think having the file extensions makes a lot of sense, it's just a bad pattern I'd fallen into.</p>
<p>To fix the issue, you need to change every import to include the file extension, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">import Button from &quot;@js/components/Button.vue&quot;;
</code></pre>
<h3>Problems with Ziggy</h3>
<p>Ziggy is a fantastic tool that helps you use Laravel defined routes in your JavaScript files. Incredibly useful when you're building and SPA (or whatever you'd call an Inertia app I suppose).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the way I had Ziggy set up no longer worked with Vite.</p>
<p>I've written another post, <a href="../articles/using-ziggy-with-laravel-inertia-and-vite.html">Using Ziggy with Laravel, Inertia (Vue) and Vite</a>, that deals with those issues. Be sure to check that out to see how I solved it.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
<p>Overall I'm very happy with Vite set up (once I got over the migration issues).</p>
<p>It's so fast it's honestly ridiculous. The way it achieves this is by not pre-compiling your JavaScript, like Webpack does, when you're in development mode. It only run all the minification and optimisation stuff when you build for production.</p>
<p>If you've recently moved to Vite from Mix and you're having issues, <a href="https://twitter.com/sebkaydesign">give me a shout on Twitter</a> and maybe we can end up helping each other!</p>
